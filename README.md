This repository contains IDL software for processing tomography data from the GSECARS
beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source.

The software uses the [tomoRecon](https://github.com/CARS-UChicago/tomoRecon) package for fast 
multi-threaded C++ preprocessing and reconstruction.  This C++ software is called from IDL.
