To use Gridrec with IDL

On Linux:

- Define the environment variable GRIDREC_SHARE to point to
GridrecIDL_Linux_32bits.so or GridrecIDL_Linux_64bits.so depending on whether
you are running 32 or 64 bit IDL.

- It is a good idea to install the patch for netCDF 4.0 if you are running IDL 7.1.
This is not essential, but will let you write .volume files larger than 4GB.

On Windows:
- You must be running at least IDL 7.1

- You must install the patch for netCDF 4.0 in IDL 7.1 available here:

- Define the environment variable GRIDREC_SHARE to point to
GridrecIDL32.dll or GridrecIDL64.dll depending on whether
you are running 32 or 64 bit IDL.

- Add the directory win32dll/ or win64dll/ to your Windows environment 
variable "Path" so Windows will find the correct version of libfftw3f-3.dll.
