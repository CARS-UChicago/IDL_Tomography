Displaying and Analysing GSECARS Tomography Data

The IDL and ImageJ software for GSECARS tomography data is contained in this tar file:
http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/idl/pub/idl_tomography.tar


                               ImageJ

To use ImageJ to read the netCDF .volume and recon.volume files:

- Download the ImageJ netCDF plugin from:
http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/lmbsoft/imagej_plugins/netcdf.html

Copy that NetCDF_.jar file to a location in the ImageJ/plugins folder directories,
such as in plugins/Input-Output/

- Take the GSE_tomo.txt file from the idl_tomography.tar file described above
and place it in the ImageJ/plugins folder.


                                IDL

To use the IDL tomo_display software with an IDL license simply place the .pro files
from the above tar file somewhere in the directories in your IDL_PATH.

If you do not have an IDL license then download the IDL Virtual Machine from 
http://www.ittvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL/IDLModules/IDLVirtualMachine.aspx

You can run tomo_display.sav in the Virtual Machine.

To use the Gridrec C library to reconstruct in tomo_display do the following:

On Linux:

- Define the environment variable GRIDREC_SHARE to point to the complete path to
GridrecIDL_Linux_32bits.so or GridrecIDL_Linux_64bits.so depending on whether
you are running 32 or 64 bit IDL.

- It is a good idea to install the patch for netCDF 4.0 if you are running IDL 7.1.
This is not essential, but will let you write .volume files larger than 4GB.

On Windows:
- You must be running at least IDL 7.1

- If you are running IDL .7 1 you must install the patch for netCDF 4.0 in IDL 7.1 available here:
http://www.ittvis.com/download/download_splash.asp?wdiid=1555&si=226579

If you are running IDL 8.0 or later this step is not needed.

- Define the environment variable GRIDREC_SHARE to point to the complete path to
GridrecIDL32.dll or GridrecIDL64.dll depending on whether
you are running 32 or 64 bit IDL.

- Add the directory win32dll/ or win64dll/ to your Windows environment 
variable "Path" so Windows will find the correct version of libfftw3f-3.dll.
